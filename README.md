# scientific-calc
In this we will create a scientific calculator using c 

Firstly we will use math library and try to add all the functions that a standard scientific calculator uses .

We will use double for add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, square root , factorial, sine, cosine , tangent , logarithm, natural logathirm.

Then we will add a main function.

While initializing choice a,b , reuslt and n.

To print the display menu we will simple code print (" The Thing that needs to be Printed ");

Then We will take user input for Choice and Add Switch case for each of the functions that are used and print their results.

Lastly we will define the functions and make them usable.
